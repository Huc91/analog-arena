I have a knack for card based games, digital an physical does not matter: Magic The Gathering, Slay The Spire, Dominion, Keyforge, LOTR LCG, Netrunner, and so on (you name it I've played it). 
Recently I decide to expand my mania and start collecting retro videogames where the gamemplay was mainly card based.  

The Gamecube, released by Nintendo in 2001, was home to a wide variety of games, including some of the most beloved RPGs of all time. One such game is Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, a unique and engaging card-based RPG.\
The game is set in a fantasy world where players take on the role of a guardian spirit, known as a "Magnus," who is tasked with protecting a young boy named Kalas. Together, they embark on a journey to uncover the truth behind a powerful force known as the "End Magnus" and save the world. Along the way, they meet a cast of colorful characters, each with their own unique personalities and stories.\
One of the most notable features of Baten Kaitos is its unique card-based battle system. Instead of using traditional RPG combat, players use cards to attack, defend, and cast spells. The cards are collected throughout the game and can be used to create different combinations for different effects.\
Some cards are "clock based", they will mutate and change according to how much time has passed since you acquired the card. As an example one of your card in your base deck is "Bamboo Shoot" a literal bamboo sprout. You can "eat" this card in combat to heal, but hey let 3 hours pass in the game and in will grow into a "Young Bamboo". It is now a sharp stick that you can use to attack.\
It's a unique and engaging system that adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.
You will spend time refining and constructing your deck but don't expect a deep and complex card game. This game has a unique and engaging approach to RPG battle systems that usually are pretty much the same formula over and over.\
The game also features a beautiful and detailed world, with stunning environments and colorful characters. The world of Baten Kaitos is filled with mystery and wonder, and players will find themselves constantly discovering new areas and secrets. The story is also well-written and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep players on their toes.\
Another notable aspect of the game is the use of a "time-flow" system, where player's choices will change the outcome of the story, allowing multiple playthroughs and different endings.

Overall, Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean is a unique and engaging RPG that offers a unique card-based gameplay experience. Its rich world, well-written story, and the use of a time-flow system make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Although it was released for Gamecube, it's a game that still holds up well today and is worth playing for those who have never had the chance to experience it before.
