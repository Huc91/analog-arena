Metroid Prime Remastered, released digitally immediately after Nintendo Direct in February 2023, and arriving in physical format on March 3, allows fans to relive Samus Aran's first iconic 3D adventure, originally released for GameCube back in 2002.

The Nintendo Switch edition of the game comes to the market over 20 years after the original masterpiece's release, technically updated and with the explosive gameplay of the past. With so much time having passed between projects, it's natural to wonder what has changed between Metroid Prime Remastered and the 2002 title, and whether the modifications are just cosmetic or also in terms of gameplay and content.

As a remastered version, the "new" Metroid Prime doesn't appear much different from the "old" game in terms of gameplay, and the most substantial modifications relate to the graphics, now in high definition with more attention to detail and brighter and more vibrant colors. However, as highlighted in our Metroid Prime Remastered review, the restoration carried out by Nintendo, Retro Studios, and Iron Galaxy Studios goes beyond mere aesthetics.

For example, taking advantage of the Switch's increased number of buttons, the control system has been updated, integrating the pointing system seen in the old Wii port through the Metroid Prime Trilogy. Loading times have also been reduced, while some minor visual details present in the GameCube version, such as Samus's shots no longer being a source of illumination, have been lost in the Switch version.

Finally, among the extras, you can now find a 3D model viewer and a section dedicated to the classic Nintendo soundtrack. The differences, therefore, may not be too pronounced, but the remastering work carried out by the Kyoto-based company is undoubtedly deserving of attention, bringing a historic title back to its full form.

In conclusion, Metroid Prime Remastered offers both old and new players the opportunity to experience the game's classic gameplay in a modern, technically advanced package. With updated controls, improved graphics, and reduced loading times, the remastered version provides an even more immersive and enjoyable experience, making it a must-play for any Metroid fan.\
