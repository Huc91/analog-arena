**Introduction**\
Are you tired of the same investment options, such as stocks and crypto? If so, it might be time to consider alternative investments, such as video games. Collecting video games can be a fun and exciting hobby, but it can also be a profitable investment. \
Collectibles, including video games, can be a great alternative investment option for those looking to diversify their portfolio. While traditional investments like stocks and bonds can provide a stable return, collectibles can offer a unique opportunity for capital appreciation. Additionally, collectibles can act as a hedge against inflation, as their value is often tied to supply and demand rather than economic factors. However, it's important to note that investing in collectibles can be challenging and requires careful research and due diligence. It's also important to understand that the value of collectibles can be highly subjective and influenced by various factors, including market trends and the condition of the item. \
In this article, we'll cover why video game collecting can be a good form of investment and provide some tips on how to get started.

**Why Collecting Video Games Can Be a Good Investment:**

1. Rarity: Just like with any collectible item, rarity drives up the value of video games. As time goes on, some games become harder to find, making them more valuable to collectors. Example: Stadium Events, a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987, is one of the rarest games in existence, with only a few known copies. In 2010, a sealed copy of the game sold for $41,300 on eBay.
2. Nostalgia: Video games can evoke strong feelings of nostalgia for people who grew up playing them. As those people get older and have more disposable income, they may be willing to pay more for the games they remember from their youth. Example: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64 is a beloved game from the late 1990s. As of 2021, a sealed copy of the game can sell for over $1,000.
3. Growing market: The video game industry has been growing steadily over the past few decades, and this growth shows no signs of slowing down. As more people become interested in video games, the demand for rare and collectible games will likely continue to increase. Example: In 2020, a sealed copy of Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System sold for $114,000 at auction, making it the most expensive video game ever sold.

**How to Start Collecting Video Games:**

2. Set a budget: Determine how much you're willing to spend on your collection and stick to it. Don't overspend on a game just because you think it might be worth a lot in the future.
3. Determine what to collect: Decide what types of games you want to collect, such as games from a particular console or a certain genre. Focus on building a collection that's meaningful to you.
4. Buy games: Start building your collection by buying games from online marketplaces like eBay or from local game stores. Look for deals and be patient – you don't need to buy every game at once.
5. Take care of your collection: Keep your games in good condition by storing them properly and avoiding damage. A well-maintained collection will be worth more in the long run.
6. Sell your games: When it's time to sell, consider selling through online marketplaces or to a collector who specializes in video games. Don't be afraid to haggle – the value of games can be subjective.

**Conclusion:** \
Collecting video games can be a fun and rewarding hobby that can also be a valid form of investment. By following these tips and doing your research, you can start building a collection that's both valuable and meaningful to you. Remember to enjoy the process and have fun along the way!
