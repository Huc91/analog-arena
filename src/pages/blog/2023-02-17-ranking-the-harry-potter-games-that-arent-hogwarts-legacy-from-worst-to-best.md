Hello, my fellow Potterheads! The Harry Potter franchise has been around for more than 20 years now and it's no secret that it has spawned a bunch of video games. Some of these games are total duds while others have been absolute bangers! We're going to rank all of the Harry Potter games that aren't the highly anticipated Hogwarts Legacy, from worst to best.

7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2 (Various Platforms, 2010 & 2011)

The Deathly Hallows games were supposed to be the epic conclusion to the series, but instead, they were the epic conclusion to the series of terrible Harry Potter games. The graphics looked like they were made from clunky polygonal faces and the gameplay was as boring as watching paint dry.

6. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Various Platforms, 2005)

Goblet of Fire was the first Harry Potter game to hit consoles, but it was definitely not the best. The game was plagued with repetitive gameplay and terrible controls. The graphics were decent for the time, but that's not saying much.

5. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Various Platforms, 2002)

The second game in the series, Chamber of Secrets, tried to build on the first game, but it just fell short. It was more of the same, with repetitive tasks and a lack of innovation. It wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't a great one either.

4. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Various Platforms, 2001)

The OG Harry Potter game was released in 2001 and, at the time, it was a pretty solid game. But let's be real, the graphics were terrible and the controls were clunky. It was faithful to the story, and it was amazing for the time being able to feel like Harry Potter. I﻿ remember playing this on Christmas 2001.

3. Lego Harry Potter (Various Platforms, 2010)

Lego Harry Potter was a fun take on the franchise, with the added bonus of Lego charm. It was definitely aimed at a younger audience, but it was still enjoyable for Potterheads of all ages. The puzzles were entertaining and the exploration was satisfying, but the combat and puzzles were a little too simple.

2. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Various Platforms, 2004)

The third game in the series, Prisoner of Azkaban, was a huge improvement over its predecessors. The graphics were better, the gameplay was more varied, and the ability to switch between the three main characters made the game feel fresh. It was definitely one of the best Harry Potter games out there.

1. Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix (Various Platforms, 2007)

The best Harry Potter game (before Hogwarts Legacy, of course) was definitely Order of Phoenix. The open-world approach to Hogwarts was a game-changer and the expanded RPG mechanics made the game feel more immersive. The graphics were great for the time and the story was on point.

In conclusion, while some of the Harry Potter games were total letdowns, there were a few gems out there. With the highly anticipated release of Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5, we are diving into the wizarding world once again!\
